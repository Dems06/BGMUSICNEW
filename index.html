    <h2>💻 I Chose BSIT – My Story</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve always been curious about how things on the internet worked. Like when I used websites like Chrome or played online games, I’d catch myself thinking, “How did they even make this?” I wasn’t just using tech—I wanted to understand it.</p>

    <p>At first, I thought, “There’s no way I could ever build something like this.” It seemed too complicated, and every time I tried to learn something new, I’d hit a wall. But once I started building small things like simple webpages or tweaking bits of code, it all started to make sense. It was slow progress, but I realized it’s about starting small and being consistent—even when it feels hard.</p>

    <p>I knew nothing about programming or IT at first. But the more I saw how technology was changing the world, the more interested I became. I watched random YouTube videos on how games or websites are made—even when I didn’t have access to a computer of my own. That curiosity never went away.</p>

    <p>Another big reason I chose BSIT is my uncle. He took up IT and is now financially stable, with a solid job and a comfortable life. He told me that IT changed his life—and that made me realize this path might open doors for me too. Not just for me, but maybe even for my family.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🚀 So I chose BSIT</h2>
    <p>Because I was curious. Because I was inspired. Because I saw the potential. I want to build something someday—something that’ll make people say, “How did they make this?”</p>
    <p class="quote">"Curiosity is the spark—success is the fire you build from it."</p>
